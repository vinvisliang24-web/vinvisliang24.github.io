    <h2>Reflection #1</h2>
    <p>
        Susan Sontag's essay "In Plato's Cave" utilizes the ancient fable of Plato's cave to present a powerful reflection of the power of photography to guide how we view the world and understand it. In the original tale of the cave, the prisoners, who are locked inside, only observe the shadows projected onto the cave wall; therefore, they believe an illusion to be reality. Sontag envisions contemporary society as a collection of such prisoners. However, in Sontag's vision of the cave, the shadows on the wall are made up of photographic images. Therefore, "In Plato's Cave" may be understood both as a critique of photographic culture and as a cautionary account of how images form both our memories of the world and our perceptions of what the world is.
The strongest impression I received while reading Sontag's essay was the assertion that photographs are not objective records but rather are subjective selections of reality. Sontag states that each photograph frames reality in the same manner as a painter selects his/her subject matter, what to include in the scene, and how to depict what is observed. Thus, each photograph represents a particular perspective in the name of "reality." Photographs inform us that we have witnessed something, yet at the same time, they mislead us into assuming we know the meaning of it. As a result, photographs beguile us into confounding the representation with the meaning of it. Because the photograph appears so realistic, we then start to regard the photograph as if it were true and accept it without considering its composition.
Sontag's statement regarding how the proliferation of photographs transforms experience into "visual data" is relevant today. We now habitually document everything—both the spectacular and the mundane—with minimal hesitation to ponder why we create these images and how they transform our experience of reality. Sontag asserts that photographs provide us with a pseudo-possession of the world. We collect photographs as mementos, assuming that to photograph an event is to possess the moment. However, this preservation paradoxically occurs when once an event is photographed, it becomes severed from lived experience. The photograph becomes a still-life object detached from the continuous nature of life. Photography provides a dualistic connection to and disconnection from the world around us. We feel close to remote events, people and places through images that can never completely encapsulate the vastness of lived experience.
Another compelling point in Sontag's arguments is how photography impacts our memory. Sontag suggests that we retain less of our experiences through our individual memories and more because of photographs of those events. We rely upon images to validate our recollections of events. Consequently, photography affects not merely public history, but our personal histories as well. Our recollections become tied to the images we can see of those events, thereby limiting our potential for experiencing emotionally and intellectually engaging with the past.
Ultimately, Sontag's use of Plato's cave serves as a challenge to question the authority we assign to images. Just as the prisoners of the cave mistake the shadow projections for reality, we risk misperceiving photographs as factual. In an environment filled with images, this propensity has increased significantly. Reading Sontag's essay promotes a more deliberate and thoughtful response to visual culture: to inquire not only what we see, but also how and why we see it. Furthermore, Sontag's essay encourages us to avoid passively consuming images and to recognize the ability of images to affect perception, belief, and memory.
Therefore, "In Plato's Cave" presents a call to awareness. It reminds us that photographs, regardless of their usefulness and appeal, represent constructed versions of reality. In order to continue to view ourselves as thoughtful observers—and participants—of a visual world, we must learn to see beyond the shadows on the wall.

 <h2>Reflection #2</h2>
    <p>
        In her recent column titled "We are sleepwalking toward disaster with 'AI slop' warping our perceptions," Nesrine Malik has warned that the proliferation of poor quality AI-generated content will dramatically alter our perception of reality and limit our ability to react to real-world events in a thoughtful manner. She explains that social media and messaging platforms are currently being flooded with "AI slop," which she describes as AI-generated images, videos, and narrative that require little-to-no human involvement and blur the lines of distinction between authentic information and fabrication. Some of this content is innocuous (fantasy), while other content has political undertones that can influence people's opinions and emotions without them realizing it. According to Malik, as AI slop continues to flood social media platforms, the AI slop does not simply clog up our newsfeeds, but it will redefine the way we understand truth.
A key part of Malik's argument is that there are now two distinct worlds of visual information online: One represents documented and actual events; the other contains AI-generated visualizations that are modeled after, embellished upon, or completely invented versions of realities. While both of these worlds exist at the level of imagination and creativity, the difference lies in the fact that the first is represented by factual documentation, whereas the second is comprised of images and video created by humans using AI software. Furthermore, since AI-generated visualizations are inexpensive and easy to produce, they are frequently distributed across platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, and X, and rarely if ever include fact checking or context. Malik notes that in addition to user-generated content, official government accounts also engage in trends based on AI-generated images and videos, therefore providing an unofficial endorsement of content that should not receive that type of validation.
The most dangerous aspect of the widespread dissemination of AI-generated content is not only the potential for misinformation to spread, but how it can permeate people's informational environments at multiple levels. Unlike news content that may appear on public forums such as Twitter or Facebook, when AI-generated content is shared in private messaging applications like WhatsApp, there is no opportunity for public commentary or fact-checking of the content to occur. Consequently, what appears to be sent to you by a trusted friend or family member, often comes with the implied trust of the person sending the message. Malik provides an example of how an elderly relative was convinced of dramatic AI-generated images and videos regarding ongoing conflicts in the world, simply because they looked realistic and were sent to him by people he trusted. Malik's example demonstrates how AI-generated slop takes advantage of human psychology, specifically confirmation bias and emotional resonance, to increase the likelihood of becoming "sticky" and continue to persuade viewers long after they begin to question its authenticity.
In addition to spreading misinformation, Malik identifies how AI-generated slop contributes to the reinforcement of pre-existing, biased, and nostalgic world views. Since AI software is trained on historical and culturally-based data, the AI-generated content that emerges from the training process, frequently replicates and reinforces existing cultural norms and biases. For example, since many forms of generative AI are trained on a broad spectrum of cultural data, the AI-generated content can reinforce conservative visual norms or romanticize previous periods of history. The resulting content can be overtly ideological and provide a sense of familiarity, as well as provide a plausible-looking rationale for extreme or regressive ideologies.
According to Malik, the reason AI-generated slop is particularly problematic, is that it adds to the overall noise of the informational environment, rather than simply adding to it. Unlike traditional forms of media that require significant amounts of human labor and editorial oversight, AI-generated content feeds into algorithmically-optimized systems designed to maximize user engagement, not to maximize truth. Social media platforms reward users with content that maximizes engagement, regardless of whether the content is true or false. Therefore, over time, this creates an informational environment in which users are increasingly unable to differentiate between what is real and what is fabricated. Ultimately, Malik warns that this confusion and desensitization could cause society to "sleepwalk into disaster"—and it is not because people do not have access to information, but because the amount of content that exists is overwhelming and the content is distorting users' perceptions of reality.
Ultimately, Malik's article is a cautionary review of how low-quality, AI-generated content can erode faith in media and reduce humanity's collective ability to address urgent global issues. The article encourages readers to think not only about the technological implications of AI-generated content, but also the psychological and social implications of living in a world where machines generate much of what we see and believe.
