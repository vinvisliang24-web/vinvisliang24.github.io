    <h2>Reflection #1</h2>
    <p>
        Susan Sontag's essay "In Plato's Cave" utilizes the ancient fable of Plato's cave to present a powerful reflection of the power of photography to guide how we view the world and understand it. In the original tale of the cave, the prisoners, who are locked inside, only observe the shadows projected onto the cave wall; therefore, they believe an illusion to be reality. Sontag envisions contemporary society as a collection of such prisoners. However, in Sontag's vision of the cave, the shadows on the wall are made up of photographic images. Therefore, "In Plato's Cave" may be understood both as a critique of photographic culture and as a cautionary account of how images form both our memories of the world and our perceptions of what the world is.
The strongest impression I received while reading Sontag's essay was the assertion that photographs are not objective records but rather are subjective selections of reality. Sontag states that each photograph frames reality in the same manner as a painter selects his/her subject matter, what to include in the scene, and how to depict what is observed. Thus, each photograph represents a particular perspective in the name of "reality." Photographs inform us that we have witnessed something, yet at the same time, they mislead us into assuming we know the meaning of it. As a result, photographs beguile us into confounding the representation with the meaning of it. Because the photograph appears so realistic, we then start to regard the photograph as if it were true and accept it without considering its composition.
Sontag's statement regarding how the proliferation of photographs transforms experience into "visual data" is relevant today. We now habitually document everything—both the spectacular and the mundane—with minimal hesitation to ponder why we create these images and how they transform our experience of reality. Sontag asserts that photographs provide us with a pseudo-possession of the world. We collect photographs as mementos, assuming that to photograph an event is to possess the moment. However, this preservation paradoxically occurs when once an event is photographed, it becomes severed from lived experience. The photograph becomes a still-life object detached from the continuous nature of life. Photography provides a dualistic connection to and disconnection from the world around us. We feel close to remote events, people and places through images that can never completely encapsulate the vastness of lived experience.
Another compelling point in Sontag's arguments is how photography impacts our memory. Sontag suggests that we retain less of our experiences through our individual memories and more because of photographs of those events. We rely upon images to validate our recollections of events. Consequently, photography affects not merely public history, but our personal histories as well. Our recollections become tied to the images we can see of those events, thereby limiting our potential for experiencing emotionally and intellectually engaging with the past.
Ultimately, Sontag's use of Plato's cave serves as a challenge to question the authority we assign to images. Just as the prisoners of the cave mistake the shadow projections for reality, we risk misperceiving photographs as factual. In an environment filled with images, this propensity has increased significantly. Reading Sontag's essay promotes a more deliberate and thoughtful response to visual culture: to inquire not only what we see, but also how and why we see it. Furthermore, Sontag's essay encourages us to avoid passively consuming images and to recognize the ability of images to affect perception, belief, and memory.
Therefore, "In Plato's Cave" presents a call to awareness. It reminds us that photographs, regardless of their usefulness and appeal, represent constructed versions of reality. In order to continue to view ourselves as thoughtful observers—and participants—of a visual world, we must learn to see beyond the shadows on the wall.
